Beginning:
  Tom had always dreamed of becoming a professional musician. 
His earliest memories are of his mother sitting down at the 
piano and playing songs for him and his two brothers. In middle 
school he joined the choir to sing, but he discovered that he 
was not a great singer. In high school he joined the band. 
Adopting the trumpet, he played at football games and other 
school events, but over his 4 years, he lost interest in his 
instrument. It wasn't until college until he finally discovered 
what his calling was.

Middle:
During college, Tom took a photography class in which he was able to 
rent out the latest and greatest cameras. It wasn't long until he fell 
in love with photography. He got a job at the colleges camera store. 
During this job, he saved enough money to buy his own camera. As Tom 
got into his senior year of college, he wasn't sure what he could do 
with his talent for photography. He applied to the top cinemotography 
companies in world. He was rejected by all.
