Beginning:
  Tom had always dreamed of becoming a professional musician. 
His earliest memories are of his mother sitting down at the 
piano and playing songs for him and his two brothers. In middle 
school he joined the choir to sing, but he discovered that he 
was not a great singer. In high school he joined the band. 
Adopting the trumpet, he played at football games and other 
school events, but over his 4 years, he lost interest in his 
instrument. It wasn't until college until he finally discovered 
what his calling was.
