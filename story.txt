Beginning:
  Tom had always dreamed of becoming a professional musician. 
His earliest memories are of his mother sitting down at the 
piano and playing songs for him and his two brothers. In middle 
school he joined the choir to sing, but he discovered that he 
was not a great singer. In high school he joined the band. 
Adopting the trumpet, he played at football games and other 
school events, but over his 4 years, he lost interest in his 
instrument. It wasn't until college until he finally discovered 
what his calling was.

Middle:
  "I've got it!" Tom put on his facepaint and went down to the train station.
He waited for a few days, but finally it came: his ticket to fame.
"Welcome aboard, son." The world-famous clown reached out his hand.
Little did Tom know, the circus was a dying form of entertainment, and this too
would pass after just a few short months. Lost and without direction, Tom turned
to the only thing he had left.

End:
Tom had a camera from his time in the circus. During this time he learned how to use 
a camera but he didn't have many people to film. Tom's passion came back to him like 
it was for the short weeks of learning the trumpet and learning to be a clown. Unlike the
other times, this passion didn't fade. It grew and so did his skills. After a few months Tom
was a wizard with the camera. He had found his calling.
